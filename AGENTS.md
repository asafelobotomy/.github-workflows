# Repository Guidelines

This repository contains reusable GitHub workflow templates.
Keep Markdown lines under 80 characters and end files with a single newline.

All directories were audited. Only yamllint warnings were found for missing
`---` document starts and non-boolean truthy values. Run the provided linting
workflows before committing new files and use `true` or `false` to satisfy
yamllint.
